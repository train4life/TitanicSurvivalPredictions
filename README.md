# Project: TitanicSurvivalPredictions
Overview: Welcome to the predictions of survivors on the titanic using machine learning models. In this repository, you'll find the code and resources to build a model that predicts the amount of passengers that would survive on the Titanic. The project aims to use the training set to predict the people that would survive or not survive because of the features about the passenger.

Instructions:

Step 1: Data Download and Resampling

Downloaded the historical data on Titanic Survivors/Non-survivors.

Step 2: Data Analysis

Analyzed the resampled data to understand patterns and trends. Filled in null values and performed OHE on some of the data.

Step 3: Model Training

Trained different models with varying hyperparameters for demand prediction. Used a test sample that constitutes 10% of the initial dataset.

Step 4: Model Testing and Conclusion

Tested the trained models using the test sample. Evaluated model performance using the Accuracy metric. Provide conclusions based on the test results.
